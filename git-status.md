# Definition: git status

The git status command allows you to know the status of the project files. 
Specifically, it shows you to know which files have changed but are not commit yet, 
which files are in the stage area, and which files are new and don't have tracking.
 
If you are using JupyterLab IDE, you can access the same information as the git status command.
In the 'git' menu and 'changes' tab, you can see the list of staged, changed and untracked files.
